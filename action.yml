description: Generate a social-first markdown changelog using GitHub APIs
inputs:
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    description: >
      GitHub token used to access the repository defined in the GITHUB_REPOSITORY input.

      It is recommended to [create a new personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the least permissions (e.g. public_repo).
      Using a service account for the GitHub Token is also highly recommended.

    required: true
    default: ${{github.token}}
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY:
    description: 'The target github repo in the format owner/repo'
    required: true
    default: ${{github.repository}}
  CONFIG_LOCATION:
    description: >
      The file location to the changelog configuration.

    required: true
    default: .github/changelog.json
  OUTPUT:
    description: >
      The output file where the changelog will be written.

      The file is created and appended, but _not_ committed back to the repository.

      It is recommended to add a post-processing step in your workflow to prepend to an existing changelog.
    required: true
    default: .github/CHANGELOG.md
  FROM:

      The beginning tag from which to generate the changelog.

      This can be queried on an unshallow-ed repository with:

      ```
      git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'v*' HEAD~
      ```

      See also [jimschubert/query-tag-action](https://github.com/jimschubert/query-tag-action).
    required: true

    description: >
      The ending tag until which the changelog should be generated.
